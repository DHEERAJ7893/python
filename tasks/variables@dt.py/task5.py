# 5) Write an program that perform all comparison operation to following two values 15 and 2?

# a = 15
# b = 2

# equal_too = a == b
# print(equal_too)
# not_equal_too = a != b
# print(not_equal_too)
# greater_than = a > b
# print(greater_than)
# less_than = a < b
# print(less_than)
# greater_equal = a >= b
# print(greater_equal)
# less_equal = a <= b
# print(less_equal)

# n=5
# for i in range(0, 5):
#     for j in range(0, i+1):
#         print("* ",end="")
#     print("\r")
    
# a = [1,2,3]
# b=a.append(4)
# print(a)
# print(b)

a = '1','11','22','21'
